        <h1>About me</h1><hr>
        <p>Hey, I'm John. I go to school at USC Upstate in Spartanburg, SC<br>
            and I've been learning so much about the tech industry and I can't<br>
            get enough. Programming has always been interesting to me and it always<br>
            seems like there is endless knowledge when learning about engineering, but<br>
            cybersecurity has become more interesting to me every day.<br><br>

            Cybersecurity has always been a huge part of the tech industry and the world<br>
            in general. As technology advances to become faster and smarter, there are individuals<br>
            who want to take advantage of businesses and normal people by infiltrating and<br>
            exposing their private information, stealing resources, demanding money, etc. As people<br>
            start to lose assets and jobs, attackers become more motivated to enable cyber warfare against<br>
            those that have no idea how to stop or prevent a cyber attack.<br><br>

            Helping those that don't have the knowledge seems like a good start in helping to alleviate<br>
            the problem but I know that more has to be done in order to fully protect people who may be<br>
            vulnerable to cyber attacks. I hope to become a big part in helping those who can't defend themselves<br>
            by gaining more knowledge and experience in engineering and Information Technology.<br><br>
